# Three Word Poems v2

The site exists to curate, collate and promote terse poetic interventions.

The site is being re-worked to solve some issues:

* The original seed of the idea contained an element of public display. Sure, a website provides publication, but we feel it's more exciting to decorate or illustrate the wider world with poems and then share documentation of that via the website. The current visual design doesn't emphasize images over text enough to highlight this aspect.
* no social media integration
* logging in is painful
* account management is non-existant
* admin tools leave something to be desired
* The project is being re-worked in Rails4 because I want to learn enough about Rails to deploy a functioning project, with front- and back- end. This repo documents that project. Forks and PRs will be welcommed at some point, but as I want to get the site running, tested and public as a learning exercise, I'd prefer discussion and pointers rather than patches for the time being. In all honesty, it's not solving any significant programming problems so I doubt anyone but a core member will want to fork it. But you never know.




## System dependencies

* rails 5
* rails 5 requires min ruby v2.2.2 and the host is using v2.2.4
* imagemagick (for Carrierwave gem)
