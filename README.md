# Three Word Poems v2

A re-working in Rails4 of the threewordpoems.com site. The site exists to curate, collate and promote terse poetic interventions.

The project is being re-worked in Rails4 because I want to learn enough about Rails to deploy a functioning project, with front- and back- end. This repo documents that project. Forks and PRs will be welcommed at some point, but as I want to get the site running, tested and public as a learning exercise, I'd prefer discussion and pointers rather than patches for the time being. In all honesty, it's not solving any significant programming problems so I doubt anyone will want to fork it, but you never know.
